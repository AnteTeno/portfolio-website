# Gemini Job Search Assistant

## Directory Overview

This directory is dedicated to managing the user's journey to find a tech job. It will serve as a central hub for storing all related information, from resume drafts to job application tracking.

## Key Files

Currently, the directory is empty besides this `GEMINI.md` file. As we progress, we can create and manage files such as:

*   `resume.md`: To draft and refine the user's resume.
*   `applications.csv`: To track job applications, including company names, roles, application dates, and statuses.
*   `interview_prep.md`: To gather notes and resources for interview preparation.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to support the user's job search. I will help create, update, and manage the files within this directory to keep the job search organized and efficient.
